Event Subscribers
=================

Should the names be {entity}/MenuSubscriber.php or Menu/{entity}Subscriber.php?
* Could be both, "Menu/" contains generic menus while "{entity}/" is specific to
  that entity

# Naming Convention

* Use directory based naming convention with {entity} being the directory name
  * Examples:
    * Product\MenuSubscriber.php
    * Order\MenuSubscriber.php
